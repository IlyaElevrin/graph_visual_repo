# graph_visual_repo
The script is a browser extension for visualizing repositories on the contributor's page.


Paste this script into tampermonkey or download it ( https://openuserjs.org/scripts/IlyaElevrin/GitHub_Contribution_Graph ).

The script was tested in firefox, I am not responsible for its performance on other browsers, because "fuck capital, go opensource".


In order for the script to work, you need to go to the user's page (update it if necessary), and the Contribution Graph button will appear next to the star button.
